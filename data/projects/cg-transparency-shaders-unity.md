title: Transparent Shaders
subtitle: Transparency shaders written in Cg for the Built-in RP in Unity
implementationDetails:
    - Standard Surface Shader using alpha:blend to control the transparency.
    - Setting RenderType and Queue to Transparent, and disabling ZWrite.
    - Writing a second Pass for the Surface Shader with alphatest and addshadow,
      to create shadows that match the transparency.
    - Writing refractions and reflections from scratch in an Unlit shader.
    - Using GrabPass to get a texture with the current pixels in the Frame Buffer.
    - Using ComputeGrabScreenPos, tex2Dproj and UNITY_PROJ_COORD to get the pixel
      from the GrabPass texture.
    - Distorting the GrabPass pixel with the Normal Map, to generate refraction.
    - Using the SkyBox/CubeMap texture to create environmental reflections.
    - Using WorldSpaceViewDir to obtain the direction of the camera to the pixel.
    - Using the built in Cg function reflect(), to get the reflection vector along
      the normal vector in world space (From UnityObjectToWorldNormal).
    - Finally getting the reflection color by sampling the cube texture with
      texCUBE and the reflection vector.
