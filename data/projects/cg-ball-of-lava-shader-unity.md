title: Ball of Lava Shader
subtitle: Written in Cg with ShaderLab, for the Built-in RP in Unity
implementationDetails:
  - Using the Perlin Noise algorithm to displace vertices in the mesh, during
    the Vertex Shader Stage.
  - Using _Time to animate the Perlin Noise, also multiplying by _Displacement
    and _NoiseVelocity to control how much and how fast the noise is.
  - Displacing the uv coordinates to simulate rotation, multiplying by
    _RotationVelocity to control the speed.
  - Generating a Mesh and making sure the UV map wraps correctly, so the Perlin
    noise doesn't generate weird shapes in the mesh.
  - Lerping between colors using steps.
