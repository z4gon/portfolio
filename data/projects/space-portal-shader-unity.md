title: Space Portal Shader
subtitle: Written in HLSL using Stencil Buffer, in the Built-in RP for Unity
implementationDetails:
    - Modeling the Meshes and UV Mapping in Blender.
    - Creating the Textures in Affinity, for Masking and doing the Tunnel and Glow
      VFX.
    - Using ZWrite Off to make the shaders not write to the Depth Buffer.
    - Using the Blend command from Shader Lab to implement traditional
      transparency and additive transparency.
    - Portal entrance implemented by writing a custom value to the Stencil Buffer
      to use as a Mask.
    - Masking the Tunnel, Hemisphere and Particles using the Stencil Test,
      checking if the Stencil Buffer has the required value written on.
    - Tunnel implemented animating the texture across the UV.y coordinates using
      _Time.
    - Particle System with custom Shader to also do the Stencil Test to Mask the
      particles inside the portal.
    - Defining the Vertex Color property so Color Over Time works in the Particle
      System.
    - Parametrizing Color, Intensity and Velocity in all the parts of the VFX, for
      full customization.
