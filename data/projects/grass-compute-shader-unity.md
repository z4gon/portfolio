title: Grass Compute Shader
subtitle: Procedural Grass System with Compute Shaders in Unity
implementationDetails:
  - Building a procedural mesh for the Grass Blades, setting vertices, normals
    and indices.
  - Placing randomly generated grass blades given an extent and a density.
  - Raycasting over the terrain to place grass following the uneven surface.
  - Sharing a compute buffer with the grass blades data between the compute
    shader and the material.
  - Using GPU Instancing to render all the grass blades.
  - Parametrizing the wind direction, wind velocity and wind force.
  - Parametrizing colors for young and old grass.
  - Using DrawMeshInstancedIndirect to draw procedurally all the meshes using
    GPU Instancing.
  - Perlin noise to calculate the amount of displacement each grass blade needs
    to have to simulate wind.
  - Using Translation and Rotation Matrices to position the vertices of the mesh
    in World Space and Clip Space.
  - Displacing the vertices of the grass blade proportionally to the UV Y
    coordinate, to make the base stay still.
  - Configuring the grass blades to cast shadows and receive shadows.
