title: Water Shader
subtitle: With Shader Graph in Unity URP
description:
  - Water shader with dynamic configurations, which can simulate several
    environmental effects.
implementationDetails:
  - Water depth effect using Scene Depth node (Camera Depth Buffer) and Screen
    Position node (Fragment Position)
  - Refractions using Screen Color node to render distorted objects behind the
    water, using Normals generated from height from a gradient noise.
  - Foam generated using the Scene Depth node and a gradient noise.
  - Waves achieved with geometry displacement, adding Normals multiplied by a
    gradient noise, effectively deforming the fragment geometry.
