title: Ground Slash VFX
subtitle: With VFX Graph in Unity for URP
implementationDetails:
  - Modeling of the 3D Meshes for the Slash and the Debris.
  - UV Mapping for the gradient texture of the Slash mesh.
  - Utilize VFX Graph
  - Spawning particles over distance, so the VFX leaves a trail of debris.
  - Decals to leave a burning effect on the ground/geometry.
  - Programming to snap the VFX to the geometry it goes over, to make it adjust
    dynamically to it.
  - Debris with random velocities, gravity and collision with plane.
  - First Person Character Controller with Input System to simulate the player
    using the VFX.
