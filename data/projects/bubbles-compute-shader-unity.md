title: Bubbles Compute Shader
subtitle: Written in HLSL, for the Built-in RP in Unity
implementationDetails:
  - Dispatching a Compute Shader from the C# Code.
  - Read/Write Render Texture in C# and HLSL to get the output of the Compute
    Shader execution.
  - Working with different kernels.
  - Sharing a Render Texture between kernels.
  - numthreads(x,y,z), thread ids and thread groups ids.
  - Rendering circles using the Bresenham Circle algorithm.
  - Passing values to the Compute Shader, floats, ints, vectors.
  - Working with ComputeBuffers and StructuredBuffers.
  - Updating the data in the Structured Buffer using a RWStructuredBuffer.
