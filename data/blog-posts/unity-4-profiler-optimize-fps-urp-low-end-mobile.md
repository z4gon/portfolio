## Connect Devices to the Profiler

- Enable `Development Build` in the build settings, to allow the profiler to find and connect to running players.

## SSAO and Post Processing

- `Screen Space Ambient Occlussion` and `Bloom Post Processing` were taking a toll on the performance.
- The first step is to disable these.

## Target Frame Rate

- A portion of the frame is still taking long, but there doesn't seem to be anything in particular causing it.
- Profiling the GPU is not available for this device, so that is not of much help.

- We can try setting the target frame rate to test if the engine can actually achieve the desired fps.

```cs
private const int TARGET_FRAME_RATE = 60;

void Start()
{
    Application.targetFrameRate = TARGET_FRAME_RATE;
    SceneManager.LoadScene(1);
}
```

- Finally, the desired 60 FPS goal is reached.
- From now on, profiling early and often will be key to identify changes that could introduce low performance.
